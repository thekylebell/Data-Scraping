This project features a data scraping script developed to extract research articles from the JSTOR database for a meta-analysis on succession planning in the public sector. The script automates the retrieval of publication metadata—such as titles, authors, abstracts, and keywords—to build a structured dataset for systematic review. Designed with efficiency and reproducibility in mind, it supports large-scale literature collection and preprocessing to identify trends, gaps, and empirical findings across studies in public administration research.
